# Lecture 1

## Goal 
- Use `git` to interact with this repository
- Use `conda` to manage python environment
- Familiar with basic Python syntax

## Introduction to Git
- [What Is Git & Why Should You Use It?](https://www.nobledesktop.com/blog/what-is-git-and-why-should-you-use-it)
    - Git is a version control system
    -  ![](https://www.nobledesktop.com/image/blog/git-branches-merge.png)
    - Ways to use git
      - command line interface (CLI)
      - desktop graphic user interface (GUI), such as [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
    - Local Repository
      - Folder-based, with a `.git` subfolder tracking the changes.
    - Remote Repository
      - ![](https://www.nobledesktop.com/image/blog/git-distributed-workflow-diagram.png)
- [Installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Basic concepts & commands
  - Create a git repository
    - create a folder: `mkdir git-intro`
    - go inside the folder `cd git-intro`
    - initialize git: `git init`
  - make a commit
    - create a file: `touch file1.txt`
    - check status: `git status`
      - staged file vs. unstaged file
    - stage a file: `git add file1.txt`
    - check status: `git status`
    - commit a change: `git commit -m 'add file1.txt'`
    - check status: `git status`
    - check Sourcetree history
  - make another commit
    - add a line in `file1.txt`
    - `git status` and `git diff` (and GUI visualization)
    - `git add .` and `git commit -m 'hello world'`
  - create a branch
    - why can't we just iterate on `master`?
    - `git checkout -b branch_1`
    - switching between branches: `git checkout master`
    - create a commit on a branch
    - merge into master
      - `git checkout master`
      - `git merge branch_1`
      - explain via Sourcetree
    - create a commit on both master and branch
    - create a conflict commit on both master and branch
  - Remote repository
    - why do we need a remote repository?
    - create a github account
    - go to [Python Preprogram repo](https://github.com/FranktheTank123/UCB-MFE-python-preprogram)
    - clone the repo: `https://github.com/FranktheTank123/UCB-MFE-python-preprogram.git`
    - how to constantly keep up-to-date?
      - Do `git pull origin main` frequently
  - Pull request 
    - [Why do we need a pull request?](https://co-learning.eu/2017/10/04/why-and-how-do-we-use-pull-request/)
    - things you need to do for pull request
      - create a branch and make some changes 
      - push that branch to remote: `git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>`
      - branch naming practice
          - `hw_<hw_number>_<firstname>_<lastname>`, e.g.: `hw_1_frank_xia`
      - create a pull request
      - assign reviewers
      - merge pull request

## Introduction to Anaconda 
- [Python versions](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/)
  - python keeps releasing new versions 
  - projects are motivated to use the latest python version at the time of creation.
  - we might end up having N projects running N different python versions
  - ... while there is only 1 python version installed on laptop 
  - ... even you managed to install different python versions, package requirement (e.g. `pandas` version) could varies project by project.
  - So in industry, we commonly use virtual environment to manage python versions and dependencies across projects  
- Virtual environment
  - a lot of choices (`venv`, `pipenv`, `conda`, `poetry`, etc.) and they are all great. It really depends on what a company chooses to offer.
  - here we choose `Conda` as
    - more data science friendly
    - it can manage other programming languages, such as R, C/C++, Ruby, Scala, etc.
- Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (sometimes company chooses [`Miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- Working with virtual env
  - creation: `conda create -n lecture_1 python=3.10`
  - check python version difference
    - global python: `python -V` or `which python`
    - local python: `conda activate lecture_1`, and repeat the 2 command above
  - deactivate: `conda deactivate`
  - list of all env: `conda env list`
  - list of the package installed in an env: `conda list -n lecture_1`
- install packages
    - **Python is very famous of its abundance of libraries.** Almost anything has a python library.
    - https://pypi.org/
    - [pip](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/) is a very common way to install/unisntall/upgrade package
      - `pip install requests` (if `requests` is not installed, install the latest version. Otherwise, do nothing)
      - `pip install requests==1.20` (define a specific version to install)
      - `pip install requests -U` (make sure `requests` is installed as the latest version)
    - Package management in the wild:
      - Case study: [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
        - all dependencies are defined in [`requirements-dev.txt`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt) 
        - pin-ed version vs. un-pin-ed version
      - Build our own requirements list
        - create a file called `requiremenets.txt`
        - add 3 lines of:
          - `requests`
          - `numpy`
          - `pandas`
        - `pip install -r requiremenets.txt`
        - check with `pip list`

## Basic Python
- Python is a scripting language
  - vs. compiled language (e.g., Java, C/C++)
- interactive shell
  - just type `python`
- execute a script
  - `python <FILE_NAME.py>`
- Write your first program
  - print "hello world" (and let's mess things up a bit)
    - `print` function
  - assign variables & inspect values
  - write comments
- For loops
```
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
  - Indentation  
  - `i`'s value
  - `range` function
    - `range(10)`
    - `range(1, 10)`
    - `range(1, 10, 3)`
    - `range(9,2,-1)`
- String
  - `type("Hello, World")`
  - `'` vs `"` vs `"""` vs `'''`
  - `len`
  - concatenation, indexing and slicing
  - you cannot edit a string

      - `2.0/1`
      - `3/2`
  - operator
    - `+ - * / ** // %`
- Booleans
  - True / False
- If statement
  - if, if/else, if/elif/else
  - `==`, `!=`, `in`, `not in`, `is`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, '<='

    - (expand here)
  - list of list

  - unordered unique list
  - create a set
  - `{}` is an empty `dict`
  - access, iteration
